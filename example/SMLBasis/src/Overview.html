<P>
These web pages contain the interface specifications for the modules of
the <B>SML Basis Library</B>, which is a standard library for the 1997
Revision of SML<B>[CITE]</B>. The SML Basis Library provides interfaces and
operations for basic types, such as integers and strings, support for
input and output (I/O), interfaces to basic operating system interfaces, 
and support for standard datatypes, such as options and lists. 
The Library does <EM>not</EM> attempt to define higher-level APIs, 
such as collection types or graphical user-interface components. 
These APIs are left for other libraries.
<P>
This document may be distributed freely over the internet as long as the
copyright notice and license terms below are prominently displayed within
every machine-readable copy. The SML Basis Library is also published as 
a book by <EM><A HREF="http://www.cup.org">Cambridge University Press</A></EM>.
 In addition to the manual pages, the book also contains tutorial descriptions
 of programming techniques and idioms for effective use of the Library's
 interfaces.
<P>
The design philosophy of the SML Basis Library is to use the SML module system
 as an organizing tool. All type, exception, and value identifiers are bound
 in some module. A small number of these, which are called <EM>pervasive
 identifiers</EM>, are also bound at top-level (<I>i.e.</I>, without
 qualification). In addition, the top-level environment defines overloading
 of some identifiers.
<P>
The components (<I>i.e.</I>, signatures, structures, and functors) of the SML
 Basis Library are divided into <EM>required</EM> and <EM>optional</EM>
 components. Required components must be provided by all SML implementations, 
while optional components are just that. In some cases, support for one
 optional component entails providing support for others.
